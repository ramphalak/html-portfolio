<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a passionate and ambitious individual dedicated to the world of coding. Currently in my first year at IIIT Kota, I am deeply engaged in honing my skills in both Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Web Development. As a budding programmer, I find the dynamic combination of these two disciplines to be an exciting and challenging journey that allows me to explore the intricacies of problem-solving and the creative aspects of building web applications.</p>

<p>My coding journey began with a fervent interest in technology and its ability to create impactful solutions. As I navigate the complexities of DSA, I am gaining a solid foundation in algorithmic thinking and problem-solving techniques. Simultaneously, delving into the realm of Web Development allows me to translate my coding prowess into tangible, user-friendly applications. I thrive on the thrill of turning concepts into functional code, and I am eager to contribute my skills to innovative projects and collaborative endeavors.</p>

<p>As a first-year student at IIIT Kota, I am immersed in a vibrant academic environment that fosters intellectual growth and collaboration. I am not only dedicated to excelling in my coursework but also actively seek opportunities to engage with coding communities and stay abreast of the latest industry trends. Through my journey at IIIT Kota, I aspire to emerge not just as a proficient coder but also as a well-rounded individual ready to make a positive impact in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
